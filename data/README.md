# Simulation Data Analysis

This folder should contain all of the data analysis performed for, and using Simulation, by the UBC 
Solar Simulation subteam. Please ensure that all relevant datasheets,
files, images, data or otherwise used supplementary materials
are contained somewhere within this directory such that we maintain
continuity of information.

## Environment
It should be noted that unlike, the requirements for 
packages used in the process of data analysis should not be contained 
within the dependencies of `Simulation`. You may find it useful to activate or create
a new virtual environment for the purposes of data analysis using `Simulation`.
