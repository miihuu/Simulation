    "Run this block to acquire the necessary imports. We also specify `matplotlib` to use a backend that is capable of doing what we need, which is not the default when using Jupyter Notebooks."

    "In order for this program to translate from the positions of the points in abstract local space on the image to the real values we want out of the datasheet, we need to provide information to perform this translation.\n",
    "When you begin the interactive session, the first step will be to place three points. The first should go at the origin, the second at the top of the $y$–axis, and the third at the rightmost (end) of the $x$–axis. Hopefully it is evident how these points will be used as reference points for the data points you place afterwards. Nonetheless, to use those points to translate between local positions on the image to actual values, you'll also need to provide information about what values are represented at each point on each axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if I had a datasheet where I had a graph of time vs position, the $x$–axis may be time between $0s$ and $10s$, and the $y$–axis may be position between $10m$ and $100m$. Thus, I'd put a point at the origin $(0, 10)$, then at the top of the $y$–axis at $(0, 100)$ and then at the end of the $x$–axis at $(10, 10)$. Before that, I would've set `x_begin=0`, `x_end=10`, `y_begin=10`, and `y_end=100`.\n",

    "You'll also need to set the following environment variables.\n",
    "1. `path`: the relative path from this directory to your image.\n",
